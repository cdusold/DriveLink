    """
    This abstract base class provides shared functionality for any hard disk linked
    class required. The other classes in this library use this class, and can be
    referred to if you need to implement your own version. (Please consider a pull
    request at https://github.com/cdusold/DriveLink if you make a good general
    implementation.)

    .. attention:: All classes in DriveLink use this class, so the following applies
                   to each of them.

    To be able to implement your own, in addition to implementing the abstract functions,
    you have to implement self.pages as a dictionary that will work for your class.

    This base class provides wrapping that automatically saves to disk, if everything
    is implemented correctly in inheriting classes. It provides the ability to access
    implementing classes directly (direct use of Class.close() reccommended) or
    through a context manager.

    .. note:: This abstract class is not thread safe, nor is it process safe. Any multithreaded
              or multiprocessed uses of implemented classes hold no guarantees of accuracy.

    You can configure how this class stores things in a few ways.

    The file_basename parameter allows you to keep multiple different stored objects
    in the same file_location, which defaults to .DriveLink in the user's home folder.
    Using a file_basename of the empty string may cause a small slowdown if more
    than just this object's files are in the folder. Using substrings of other basenames
    or basenames that end in numbers may cause irregular behavior. Using a file_location
    of the empty string will result in files being placed in the environment's current
    location (i.e. what `os.getcwd()` would return).

    The size_limit parameter determines how many items are kept in each page, and the
    max_pages parameter determines how many pages can be kept in memory at the same
    time. If you use smaller items in the class, increasing either is probably a
    good idea to get better performance. This setting will only use about 128 MB if
    standard floats or int32 values. Likely less than 200 MB will ever be in memory,
    which prevents the RAM from filling up and needing to use swap space. Tuning
    these values will be project, hardware and usage specific to get the best results.
    Even with the somewhat low defaults, this will beat out relying on python to
    use swap space.
